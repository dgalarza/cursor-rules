# cursor-rules

A public collection of rules, snippets, and custom workflows I use with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) to support faster, more focused development.

---

## ✳️ What’s in here

- `rules/`: Code standards and reusable refactoring rules

---

## 🔧 Usage

These rules are written to be used with [Cursor’s](https://cursor.sh) built-in automation features and AI assistance.

> I’m not building a plugin—just documenting helpful patterns and setups.

To use:
1. Browse the `rules/` folder
2. Copy the rule you want into your local Cursor workspace
3. Adjust the prompt or code as needed

## 💡 Why I Made This

- I wanted a reproducible way to share coding patterns with collaborators
- Cursor rules help standardize and speed up work without enforcing rigid linting
- Writing rules improves my own thinking around refactoring and clarity
